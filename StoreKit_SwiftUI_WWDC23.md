## Adding Decorative Icons to the Store View

**Topic:** Adding decorative icons to the store view

```swift
struct BirdFoodShop: View {
    @Query var birdFood: [BirdFood]

            BirdFoodProductIcon(productID: product.id)
        }

## Creating a Container for Custom Store Layout

**Topic:** Creating a container for a custom store layout

```swift
struct BirdFoodShop: View {
    @Query var birdFood: [BirdFood]
 
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                if let (birdFood, product) = birdFood.bestValue {
                    
                }
            }
            .scrollClipDisabled()
        }
        .contentMargins(.horizontal, 20, for: .scrollContent)
        .scrollIndicators(.hidden)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .background(.background.secondary)
    }
}
```

Explanation: This code introduces a `ScrollView` and a `VStack` to create a container for a custom store layout. The `ScrollView` allows scrolling through the content, while the `VStack` arr

anges the child views vertically with spacing between them. The container is customized further by setting content margins, hiding scroll indicators, and applying a secondary background color.

## Adding Product View to the Container

**Topic:** Adding product view to the container

```swift
struct BirdFoodShop: View {
    @Query var birdFood: [BirdFood]
 
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                if let (birdFood, product) = birdFood.bestValue {
                    ProductView(id: product.id)
                }
            }
            .scrollClipDisabled()
        }
        .contentMargins(.horizontal, 20, for: .scrollContent)
        .scrollIndicators(.hidden)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .background(.background.secondary)
    }
}
```

Explanation: This code adds a `ProductView` to the container within the `VStack`. The `ProductView` displays detailed information about a specific product, such as its name, price, and purchase button. The specific product to display is determined using the `bestValue` property from the `birdFood` array.

                        BirdFoodProductIcon(
                            birdFood: birdFood,
                            quantity: product.quantity
                        )
                    }
                }

        .scrollIndicators(.hidden)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .background(.background.secondary)
    }
}
```

Explanation: This code enhances the `ProductView` by adding a closure that creates a `BirdFoodProductIcon` as a decorative icon within the product view. The `BirdFoodProductIcon` is associated with the specific bird food and its quantity. It adds visual appeal to the product view.

## Adding More Containers and Product Views

**Topic:** Adding more containers and product views

```swift
struct BirdFoodShop: View {
    @Query var birdFood: [BirdFood]
 
    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            VStack(spacing: 10) {
                if let (birdFood, product) = birdFood.bestValue {
                    ProductView(id: product.id) {
                        BirdFoodProductIcon(
                            birdFood: birdFood,
                            quantity: product.quantity
                        )
                    }
                    .padding()
                    .background(.background.secondary, in: .rect(cornerRadius: 20))
                }
            }
            .scrollClipDisabled()
            Text("Other Bird Food")
                .font(.title3.weight(.medium))
                .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, alignment: .leading)
            ForEach(birdFood.premiumBirdFood) { birdFood in
                BirdFoodShopShelf(title: birdFood.name) {
                    
                }
            }
        }
        .contentMargins(.horizontal, 20, for: .scrollContent)
        .scrollIndicators(.hidden)
        .frame(maxWidth: .infinity)
        .background(.background.secondary)
    }
}
```

Explanation: This code adds more containers and product views to the `VStack`. Each product view is enclosed within a container for styling purposes. The product views are wrapped in a padding and background modifier to provide visual distinction. Additionally, a text view is added to display the title "Other Bird

 Food," and a `ForEach` loop is used to iterate over premium bird food items and display them in a `BirdFoodShopShelf`.
